WooLam shared-key auth protocol 1992 Version of Gordon, Jeffrey. A and B are the two parties involved in the protocol, and S is the trusted server.
The security goal is to authenticate the identity of A to B and vice versa.
The flow of the protocol is as follows:
A -> B : A
B -> A : N
A -> B : { m3, N }_kAS
B -> S : { m4, A,{ m3, N }_kAS }_kBS
S -> B : { m5, N }_kBS
B: verify { m5, N }_kBS = the message from S
