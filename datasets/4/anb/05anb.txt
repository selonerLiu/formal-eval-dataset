WooLam shared-key auth protocol Corrections of Gordon, Jeffrey. A and B are the two parties involved in the protocol, and S is the trusted server.
The security goal is to authenticate the identity of A to B and vice versa.
The flow of the protocol is as follows:
A -> B : A
B -> A : N
A -> B : { m3, B, N }_kAS
B -> S : A,B,{ m3, B, N }_kAS
S -> B : { m5, A, N }_kBS
B: verify { m5, A, N }_kBS = the message from S
