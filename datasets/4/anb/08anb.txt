Otway Rees protocol Version of Otway Rees. 
The security goal is to authenticate the identity of A to B and vice versa, and to establish a shared secret key between A and B.
The flow of the protocol is as follows:

A -> B: (C, A, B, { Na, C, A, B }_kA)
B -> S: (C, A, B, { Na, C, A, B }_kA, { Nb, C, A, B }_kB)
S -> B: (C, { Na, k }_kA, { Nb, k }_kB)
B -> A: (C, { Na, k }_kA)
