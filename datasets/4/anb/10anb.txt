EKE, Bellovin, Merritt, Oakland 92, section 2.1. A and B are two parties that want to communicate securely.
The security goal is that, under the premise that both parties only share a weak password, it is possible to achieve secure mutual authentication and negotiate a high-strength session key.
The flow of the protocol is as follows:
1. A->B: (hostA, {EA}P)
2. B->A: ({{R}EA}P)
3. A-->B: {challengeA}R
4. B-->A: {challengeA, challengeB}R
5. A-->B: {challengeB}R
